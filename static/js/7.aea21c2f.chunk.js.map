Welcome to my blog. I wanted to this after learning React in my free time. During my internship with Carigos, I sat with the product/engineering team, and I thought whatever the frontend developer was doing was quite cool!`}</p>\n      <p>{`Actually, in Year 1 Semester 2 I used a Bootstrap 4 template to create my website, and in Year 2 Semester 2 (during my exchange), I started and (almost) completed the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/\"\n        }}>{`Web Developer’s Course by Colt Steele on Udemy`}</a>{`. His course was so good taht I decided to also buy his `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/\"\n        }}>{`advanced course`}</a>{`. I used it to learn more about Asynchronous Javascript, ES2015 and React.`}</p>\n      <p>{`I was convinced that learning React is advantageous for me as I can create the frontend for my analytics, bringing non-technical people closer to analytics. As the line between the business and technical sides become blurred, I feel that breaking down this division is important.`}</p>\n      <p>{`I chose React over Angular and Vue because React has the same syntax as React Native, and I can use my expertise to build mobile applications in the future. `}</p>\n      <p>{`It was not easy learning, however. Being a Business student I did not have prior programming experience in Javascript. Javascript actually went through several updates since 2015, and there were many new concepts I had to learn such as callbacks, promises, async await, array methods like forEach, map, reduce, constructor functions, using XHR vs fetch vs jQuery vs Axios, creating my own APIs to call from using Node, Express and Mongo, bind/apply/call, closures, Asynchronous JS concepts like stack/heap, setInterval, setTimeout. `}</p>\n      <p>{`I had to learn all of this before moving to React fundamentals, which consist of many things to learn as well. I only covered state, props and functional components. But there are other concepts like Redux which I did not learn as of now.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Even though it was quite stressful learning challenging concepts, I think I have improved (a little) over the past 3 months I have spent at Carigos, in my areas of interest (Data Analytics, Amazon Web Services and React). I also had the chance to practice the basics of CSS, since I used `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.styled-components.com/\"\n        }}>{`Styled-Components`}</a>{` for the interactive dashboard I created.`}</p>\n      <p>{`That’s all for today! I will (try to) update this blog on my learning in and out of my school courses from now on, and it will probably be on Keras, React and studying for my AWS Cloud Architect certification. `}</p>\n      <p>{`Thanks for reading! :)`}</p>\n    </div>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
